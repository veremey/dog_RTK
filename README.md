# egghead-rtkq

A sample app for an egghead course showing how to adopt rtk query in an existing redux / rtk application. The fully migrated application can be found in the [rtkq](https://github.com/xjamundx/egghead-rtkq/tree/rtkq/src) branch. The `lesssons/` folder has code snippets specific to each lesson.

### Setup

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Go to the My Dogs page and add at least 3 dogs.

**Notes**

- Make sure to include dogs of different breeds, sizes and ages.
- Added dogs should persist refreshes as long as you keep the same browser tab open.

### Notes

- This sample app was built using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [mock service worker](https://mswjs.io/).
- The royalty-free dog images came from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/search/dog/).
